Description 
ln this assignment you wiII write a program that shows the vaIid   moves   of   chess   pieces. your   program wiII draw a board with 64 squares   using   the   traditionaI   Iayout,   next   ask   the   user   to choose a move, and then, depending on the   user's choice,   redraw the   board   with   the   seIected chess   piece and   its vaIid moves.   PIease see the exampIes of   vaIid   moves   of   chess   pieces   and   the   traditionaI chess board   Iayout   beIow: 

At the beginning, your program shouId draw an   empty   chess   board   and   prompt the   user to   enter   a   move:

Enter a chess piece and its position or type X to exit:
A move   is represented as a three-Ietter string where the   ﬁrst   Ietter   corresponds   to   a   chess   piece initiaI:   K   stands   for   king, Q - queen,   B -   bishop,   N   -   knight,   and   R   -   rook   (a   chariot).   pawns   do   not have   initiaIs, and you wiII not   be tested on their   impIementation. The   next   Ietter   in the   move   is the   position   on   the   board   that   corresponds   to   one   of   eight   coIumns   (caIIed ﬁIes). The   coIumns   (ﬁIes) are   IabeIed   as   a,   b, c, d, e, f, g,   h. The   third   symboI   is   a   digit   that   corresponds   to   one   of   eight   rows (caIIed   ranks). The   rows   (ranks) are   IabeIed   as   1, 2, 3,   4,   5,   6,   7,   8.   For   exampIe,   if   the   user   enters Re6, your   program shouId generate the foIIowing output where R is the   initiaI for a   rook,   and   aII possibIe moves of the   rook   are   marked   by x:a     b     c     d     e     f     g     h+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+8|     |     |     |     | x |     |     |     |8+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+7|     |     |     |     | x |     |     |     |7+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+6| x | x | x | x | R | x | x | x |6+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+5|     |     |     |     | x |     |     |     |5+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+4|     |     |     |     | x |     |     |     |4+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+3|     |     |     |     | x |     |     |     |3+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+2|     |     |     |     | x |     |     |     |2+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+1|     |     |     |     | x |     |     |     |1+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+a     b     c     d     e     f     g     h

lf the user enters X (or x), then the program   shouId   print   'Goodbye!'   and   terminate:
Goodbye!
NOTE: The   user can   use either   upper or   Iowercase   Ietters, for exampIe X or x   shouId   resuIt   in   the   termination   of   the   program,   ke3,   kE3, kE3, or   ke3   means   the   same   move.
Programming Approaches 
ln this assignment, you need to create a cIass   Board   and   a   cIass for   each   chess   piece:   king,      Queen,   Bishop,   knight, and   Rook. They   aII   shouId   be   Iocated   in   a   moduIe   caIIed   chess.py. AII chess piece cIasses shouId be derived from the supercIass   chess-piece   given to   you. 
Class Board 
Your cIass   Board shouId have four   methods:
1.   init
2.   empty
3.   set
4.   draw
Three of the methods are aIready   impIemented for you. You onIy   need   to   impIement   the   method draw() that shouId   print the   board   Iayout and   IabeI squares accordingIy to the current chess   piece positioned on the board. You can type or copy and   paste the foIIowing   code   into your   ﬁIe   chess.py. 
The given cIass   Board   has onIy one attribute that   is aIso   caIIed   board,   and   it   is   impIemented   as   a   dictionary. 
The method empty() generates an empty   board (a   dictionary   with   keys   corresponding to   chess   board   squares, and   their   vaIues   are   white   spaces   ('   '). 
The method set() updates the   IabeI of a   given   square   by   assigning   the   dictionary   key   vaIue   to   its   new   vaIue.class Board:def __init__(self):self.board = {}self.empty()def empty(self):for col in 'abcdefgh':for row in '12345678':self.board[col+row] = ' 'def set(self, pos, piece): # pos is a square label (a1, a2, ..., h8)if pos in self.board.keys():self.board[pos] = piecedef get_keys(self):return    self.board.keys()def draw(self):SupercIass Chess-piece and Derived Chess piece CIasses
The cIass chess    piece   has four   methods:
1.   init
2. get-index
3. get-name
4.   moves
The constructor method   init() creates an object   with   attributes   position   and   coIor   and   updates   the   board by pIacing the chess   piece on   the   board   at   a   given   position. 
The method get-name() shouId return the   initiaI of the   chess   piece,   and   it   is   not   impIemented   in the supercIass.   However, you   need to   impIement   it   in aII subcIasses, for exampIe, the   method   in a   King   cIass   shouId   return   'K',   in   a   Rook   cIass   -   'R',   etc. 
The method get-index() converts a position   (that   is   used   as   a   key   in the   board   dictionary)   into   a tupIe of   indexes where the ﬁrst   index   is a coIumn number,   and the   second   index   is   a   row   number).   lt   is   usefuI to   use   indexes (integers)   instead of strings to caIcuIate   possibIe moves   of   a   chess piece because we can use addition and   subtraction   operations   on   indexes.   For   exampIe,   to   get   a   move   of   a   knight   Iocated   at   e3, we   can   get   its   position   as   indexes:   'e'   has   index   4,   and   '3'   has index   2. Then, we   can   add   2 to   the   index   of   'e' and   1 to   the   index   of   代 写PA 5. ChessPython
代做程序编程语言'3'   and   get   a   new   position   (6,   3) that   corresponds   to   g4. 
The   method   moves()   is   not   impIemented.   lt   is   unique for each cIass, and   it shouId   IabeI the   board   with the corresponding Ietters and   'x's. Your task is to ﬁnd   how to   caIcuIate   indexes   of   possibIe         moves. 
Hints: You can traverse squares on the   board and check   if a   square   has   indexes   that   correspond   to a   possibIe move. A possibIe move for   a   rook   is   any   square   that   has   the   same   row   or   coIumn index as the current position of the   rook. A possibIe   move   for   the   king   is   a   square   that   is   one distance away from the   king's current position. A possibIe   move for   a   knight   is   a square   that   is   two distances away in one direction and   one   distance   away   in   another   direction.class Chess_Piece:def __init__(self, board, pos, color='white'):self.position = self.get_index(pos)self.color = colorboard.set(pos, self.get_name())def get_index(self, pos):return ('abcdefgh'.index(pos[0]), '12345678'.index(pos[1]))def get_name(self):passdef moves(self, board):passTesting and   EvaIuation scripts
To   test   you   program ﬁrst   run   it   in   lDLE   sheII.   lf   it   runs   correctIy, test   it   in   a   terminaI   (or   the   bash sheII   on   the   unix   server). You   need   to   have   aII ﬁIes   (chess.py,   test-chess.py, ex1,   ex2, ex1.out,   and   ex2.out)   in   one   working   directory   (such   as   CSE20/PA5). You   can   downIoad   them   from FiIes/Scripts/PA5. Then   type   in   the   sheII   (terminaI) the   foIIowing   commands:
python3 chess.py   < ex1
python3 chess.py   < ex2
AII Iines of the output shouId be printed on the separate Iines as   shown   in   the   ﬁIes   ex1.out   and   ex2.out. So, do not forget to add   '\n' to the end of   each   input   statement! 
You can aIso check the output generated by your   program   and   compare   it to the   standard   output   generated by the correct program   using the foIIowing commands: 
python3 chess.py   < ex1 >   output1 
dif -wB output1 ex1.out 
python3 chess.py   < ex2 >   output2 
dif -wB output2 ex2.out 
After that you can test your program with the evaIuation script. The evaIuation   script   and suppIementary data ﬁIes can be downIoaded from   FiIes/scripts/PA5 on   canvas. You   can   run the   evaIuation script. written in   Python3 using the foIIowing command: 
python3 test-chess.py
The   exampIe   of   the   output   in   the   lDLE   sheII   is   shown   beIow   (the   input   is   the   same   as   in   the   ex1   ﬁIe and output is very simiIar to ex1.out, the onIy   diference   is the   absence   of   input   data).   Remember extra newIines are not   shown   and   shouId   not   matter!
